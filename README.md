 This is a Simon game web application where users have to press the on-screen button corresponding to the shown color pattern. 

 How to Play: There are four color blocks corresponding to the color green ðŸŸ¢, red ðŸ”´, yellow ðŸŸ¡ and blue ðŸ”µ. To start, press the button 
 below. Click on the color that blinks. After each successful round, the game will add another color to the sequence. You have to memorize 
 the sequence in the right order and have to click the colors according to the right sequence to clear the current level. If you get the 
 sequence right then you'll get promoted to the next level and the game will continue in this way. Or, if you get the sequence wrong and 
 click on any wrong color in the order then, the game will be over and you have to press the button below to restart the game.
